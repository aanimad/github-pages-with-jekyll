## Cable Box | Wire Bin
This is a cable organizer that covers up the messy surge protector/spike buster which often lies on your computer desk or behind the TV
This simple to install & stunning looking box makes your space neat and tidy. It also streamlines the cables coming in and going out of the surge protector.
Bluelounge's Cable Box is made from high-density flame retardant plastic considering the fact that surge protector heats up at times.
Bluelounge's Cable Box comes in Black, White, Moonlight Blue and Light Sage. It does match your furniture & living space, elevate the ambiance and give you a peace of mind.

I welcome constructive criticism and I would love to hear your thoughts about cable management.
